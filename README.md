# Advent of Code 2022

These are my [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzle solutions and puzzle running tool. The solutions and tool are written in Swift and can be run as a command line tool on macOS or with the included Xcode project. The tool can optionally download and cache puzzle input from adventofcode.com or print private leaderboard statistics if a session cookie is provided.

## Running Puzzles

### Usage

```
USAGE: swift run AdventOfCode <puzzle-index> [--cookie <cookie>] [--test-input <test-input>] [--force-download]

OPTIONS:
  --cookie <cookie>       The cookie named "session" for adventofcode.com. Used to authenticate for downloading puzzle input. Optional if puzzle input is already stored in ./Input/<puzzle-index>.txt or
                          provided with --input. 
  --test-input <test-input>
                          An input string to test run the puzzle with. The input file will not be downloaded or read if test input is provided.
  --force-download        Force a download of puzzle input even if there's a local file cached. 
```


### Example

```
$ swift run AdventOfCode 1 --cookie $AOC_COOKIE --force-download

## Viewing Leaderboard

The `AdventOfCode` tool can be used for viewing private leaderboard results, including the timestamp each user completed each part of a puzzle.

```
USAGE: swift run AdventOfCode view-leaderboard <leaderboard-id> [--puzzle-index <puzzle-index>] [--cookie <cookie>]

OPTIONS:
  --puzzle-index <puzzle-index>
                          The puzzle number to print statistics for. 
  --cookie <cookie>       The cookie named "session" for adventofcode.com. 
```

### Example

<pre>
$ swift run AdventOfCode view-leaderboard 976765 --cookie $AOC_COOKIE --puzzle-index 2

## Retrieving Your Session Cookie
You will need to provide a session cookie to authenticate for downloading puzzle input or leaderboard stats. In Safari the cookie can be retrieved by copying the value of "session" under Develop ‚Üí Show Web Inspector ‚Üí Storage.

You can store your session cookie in an environment variable to ease running puzzles (e.g. `echo 'export AOC_COOKIE=<session-cookie>' >> ~/.zshenv`).

## Adding New Puzzles

1. Add a new struct in `Sources/AdventOfCode/Puzzles` that conforms to `Puzzle` and include in the `AdventOfCode` and `AdventOfCodeTests` targets in Xcode.
2. Update `PuzzleSet.swift`'s `puzzlesByIndex` to map the puzzle index to the new struct.
3. Implement `solve1(input:)` and `solve2(input:)` to provide the puzzle solutions.

## Testing

Unit tests for running puzzles with custom test input are available in `PuzzleTests.swift`. These can be run with the `AdventOfCodeTests` target.

### Example

```swift
class AOCTests: XCTestCase {

    func testAOC1() {
        let puzzle = AOC1()
        let input = "1721,979,366,299,675,1456"
        
        XCTAssertEqual(puzzle.solve1(input: input), 514579)
        XCTAssertEqual(puzzle.solve2(input: input), 241861950)
    }

}
```
